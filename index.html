             <p> In 2018, Sarah W. adopted Lemon (short for Lemonade) from Northern Alabama. Lemon quickly became loved by everyone who was introduced to her, whether they only saw her for a few seconds while she was on walks or whether they played fetch with her every week. Lemon was born on September 23rd, 2018 and just recently celebrated her third birthday. Her favorite chew toy is a red sweater toy that she has chewed nearly to shreds, followed by a t-bone chewie. Some snacks that Lemon enjoys are prosciutto, hard-boiled eggs, and ribs. Lemon loves to go to the park with Sarah so that she can run fast and play in the mud and water. </p>
