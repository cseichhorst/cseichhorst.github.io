Hi! I am a graduate student at the University of Alabama, receiving my Master of Arts in Religion in Culture. I graduated from Nebraska Wesleyan University in 2021 with a Bachelors degree in Philosophy & Religion and Psychology. 
	<p>
	<p>
My main research areas include new religious movements and law enforcement. More specifically, I am interested in how law enforcement agencies classify, designate, and label groups; whether they be labeled a religion, a terrorist organization, a cult, a social group, etc. The majority of the research I conducted as a Bachelors student was on the conflict between the FBI/BATF and the Branch Davdians that took place outside of Waco, TX in 1993. 
	</p>
	<p>
I have held numerous internships with various law enforcement agencies, including the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, The Lancaster County Sheriffs Office, and the Lancaster County Department of Corrections. It is my hope that educational opportunities and interdisciplinary cooperation between scholars of religion and law enforcement agencies will result in a decrease of violent conflicts between law enforcement and groups often labeled as marginal, fringe, and/or cults. 
	</p>
	<p>
Along with my Master of Arts, I will be receiving a certificate in Digital Humanities. Some of my work in Digital Humanities includes contributing to the (Un)Civil Religion webpage, creating and editing podcasts, and learning html and css. 
	</p>
	<p>
Outside of academic work, I like to spend my free time baking, hiking and camping, reading, and making useless spreadsheets.
